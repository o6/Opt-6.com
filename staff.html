		<img src="img/staff.png" alt="" /><span style="font-size: 14pt; float:right">Carter Allen - Slave Driver</span><br /><br /> <p>Hey there lovely visitor/customer/lobbyist/bot/script/complainer. Nice to see you again. My name's Carter Allen, and I am the head developer for § Products, as well as the founder of the company. By "head developer," I mean that I develop the heads of the other developers so that they can actually work. Kidding. Well, kind of. I'm writing to you from beautiful Colorado, where the weather is a balmy 30 degrees Fahrenheit and the air conditioning was left on all day. I am going to kill whoever did that...</p>
<p>One of the things you may notice as you browse the other profiles is that we're all pretty damn young. Which is true. But I am the leader of the group. Not to say that the others don't make decisions, but when it comes down to the wire, I am usually there to whip people into shape. Unless I'm chatting with my girlfriend, in which case nothing gets done by anyone.</p>
<p>And with that, I leave you with "To miss something, you must lose it. Yet so many of us miss what we never actually had."</p>

<img src="img/staff.png" alt="" /><span style="font-size: 14pt; float:right">Wil Nichols - Mr. Incredible </span><br /><br /> <p>Well, Hello there. I'm Wil. And... Sadly, I don't know who you are. I have been a maccie for many years now, a true to heard, dedicated mad-maccie ever since I was entranced by the wonderful aqua interface of OS X Tiger. Of course, after going Mac, I had to mod it. Aqua Extreme, Mac OS X Tigger, they were all good. Back in the good days of Shapeshifter *sigh*. Then came Leopard, and the theming community died. Eventually, it was discovered that COREUI (the theming system on Leopard) could be disabled, and the basic form of Tiger theming returned. Then, the advancements with the artfiles were made, and here we are now. I had been looking for an app with possibility to fill the gaping void that Shapeshifter had left, when I stumbled upon Kameleon. I quickly attached myself to the project and off we sailed.<br />I eventually became the web, UI, and graphics designer for opt-6, and here we are today. </p>

<p>I enjoy the practicing the piano, which I have now been playing for nine years. I also enjoy Volleyball, Ultimate Frisbee, and biking. You may learn more about me at <a href="http://www.wilnichols.com">my website</a>.</p>

<p>Now, my friends, I will leave you with the words of Albert Einstein: "The difference between stupidity and genius is that genius has its limits."</p>

<img src="img/staff.png" alt="" /><span style="font-size: 14pt; float:right">Preston Mueller - That Guy </span><br /><br /> <p>Preston, a web developer and specialist in server and network
administration, lives in Denver, CO and is a member of the Opt-6 team. He began working with Opt-6 in early 2008 as a friend to the senior developer and creator of Opt-6, Carter Allen. Within Opt-6, Preston develops the PHP/MySQL backend for many different realms including the Kameleon theme database and Kameleon activation.</p>
<p>In his spare time, he enjoys playing the cello, skiing, biking, and tennis.</p>

<img src="img/staff.png" alt="" /><span style="font-size: 14pt; float:right">George Woodliff-Stanley - Other </span><br /><br /> <p>George WS is an 8th-grade developer who loves to grow berries in his back yard, ride his bike, listen to loud rock music, play with his cats, and eat sushi. When he's not doing any of these things, he's usually sitting in front of his computer programming. He became interested in programing soon after he got his MacBook in April of 2008. He enjoyed experimenting with his computer's system files and exploring the effects of this... some good, and some not so good. After thoroughly destroying and gaining an understanding of his system files, he talked to his good friend Carter Allen about his preference-modifying application, xMod. Carter explained how the application worked, and George was very intrigued by the simplicity of the language Carter had used to program it: Applescript. George then began learning Applescript, and now works with Carter to bring many of the applications in the Alpha stage to life. Recently, he has also been working very hard to learn Cocoa Touch so that he can develop for the new iPhone 2.0 software, because he has been anticipating the app store for a long time, and has some ideas for really great applications that he would love to bring to life on his iPod Touch. However, so far, the only things that he is very good at programing for his iPod are super fun levels for Andy Qua's excellent iPhone game, Cube Runner.</p>
