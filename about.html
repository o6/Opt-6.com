			<p>The thing about § Products is that it is a company with a sense of humor. That, my friends, is rare. What is even more rare is a company with the extremely twisted sense of humor that we embody here at §. Apart from our sense of humor, I guess you could say we are unique in a few other ways.</p>

	      
<p>The staff of § consists of very few people, none of which are actually getting paid consistently (Shh, don't tell them that.) To pay homage to the Breakfast Club, I ask you all to see us in our simplest, most basic forms. A depressed teen, a sleep deprived student, an excited artist, and a detached genius. Figure it out yourself.</p>


<p>One of the things that lead developer, Carter Allen, has a problem with is starting a lot of projects and only finishing a few. Thus, § ends up with lots of random apps floating around, that sometimes work, and sometimes don't. Because of how confusing that can get, we developed a system of terms to describe what stage an app is at in development. First, comes Alpha. When a program is in alpha, then it has been thought about, written about, but not started. When it is in beta, it has been started, but is so far from being finished, it will probably not work. Finally, the release version comes far after the beta. Believe us, that is where the magic happens.</p>
