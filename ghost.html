<p><b>Ghost can hide anything, the </b>po<b>ssibilities a</b>r<b>e e</b>n<b>dless.</b></p>
 

<p>There are lots of files on your computer that you can't see. Apple has conveniantly hidden many system files from you, so that your computer doesn't look like an ugly, cluttered mess.However, they have not provided any easy way to create your own hidden files, or even to view theirs. Ghost provides a simple, user friendly way to do both of these things. Simply drag and drop a file or folder into the list, then uncheck (or check) its checkbox and the item will be instantly hidden or un-hidden.</p>

<p><b>*Note*</b> Ghost is not a way to encypt or secure files, any Mac saavy person can easily acess your hidden files. It is simply to remove things out of plain sight, and keep them out of mind when you don't want them in your way. Of course, if you wanted to be extra careful, you could encrypt a file with BitEncrypt <em>then</em> hide it...</p>

<p><b>*Another Note*</b> It is not a good idea for you to try to hide your hard drive with Ghost. Ghost can hide it, but can't unhide it. Never fear, if you DO hide something that ghost can't unhide, it can still be recovered. This all has to do with permissions; some files require your password to unhide. If you have encountered these problems and need help, contact § Support. Maybe some day in an update I'll make Ghost compatable with files that have different permissions.</p>

<p><b>*More Important Than Those Other Dumb Notes*</b> I swear to god, Ghost does NOT just hide a file by putting a period in front of its name, it actually uses the SetFile UNIX Executable to change its visibility attribute, if you have any clue what that means. </p>
